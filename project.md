# Talking Maps overview

Do you want to tell a story with your maps?
Are you simply looking for a new way to present your studies?

TalkingMaps is the service that you need.

## Why?

We are the TenOli team (Martino & Federico). We love maps and web programming and we are Open Source enthusiasts.
We wanted to create an editor for story-maps that was easy to customize, easy to share and easily integrated with QGIS maps and other web resources, and, obviously, totally Open Source.
All this is done to be free to tell our stories whitout any limitations.
